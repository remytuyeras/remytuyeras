## Hello there!
On this github you will find projects related to my research as well as some very old school projects that I put here for storage purposes.

## Projects I currently focus on

### HaploDynamics
This is a cloud-native software framework for fast generation of genomic data simulations. One of the features I am currently working on is to make this project composable with your own machine learning pipeline. 
$$\mathsf{HaploDXGenerativeFunction}(\mathsf{YourMutationModel}(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})) \longrightarrow \\mathrm{Genomic Data with your mutation/positional model}$$

### Pedigrad
This is a software I have been working on for the last few years. I intend to put out a new version soon, with linear algebra to find combinatorial genetic effects from variant call and phenotype data.

### Homomorphic Encryption
I intend to add a project on a new model for Homomorphic Encryption. More to come later this year.
